###### `What server framework did you choose and why?`
######  I used Ruby on Rails as my Server framework. The reason why I choose ROR was because of the following reasons :
* ###### Its open source.
* ###### Making changes to ROR files using the IDE Ruby Mine was quick and efficient.
* ###### When I went through its tutorial it felt more easy to understand.
###### `What client framework did you choose and why?`
###### I used JavaScript for manipulating DOM objects and AJAX for making RESTful API calls to the server and getting the data from the server. The only reason why I choose this is because it is something that I am familiar with, and making a API calls using AJAX couldn't is very easy.
###### `What aspect of the implementation did you find easy, if any, and why?`
###### Almost all the things that I did, as part of this projct, were not easy however, displaying the JSON data in a tabular form didn't take me as much time. 
###### `What aspect of the implementation did you find hard, if any, and why?`
###### The following tasks listed below are ordered according to the dificculty i faced while doing them.(1 being the most difficult).
1. ###### Understanding what to edit where in ROR. 
2. ###### Debugging why Google Maps API wasn't getting displayed.
3. ###### Debugging why the Markers were not getting displayed on the Map.
###### `What components OTHER than your client and server framework did you install, if any, and if so, what is their purpose for your solution?`
###### I installed the following software :
* ##### Ruby Mine.
  ###### For editing ROR components. Its predictive text feature helped me in        understanding the various attributes and functions that may be used.
* ##### Sublime Text 2.
  ###### Since I am working on a MAC, the TextEdit App doesn't fulfil my need of     looking at important parts of a file by just glancing through it. _Sublime Text 2_ diplayed important components of the files in different colours, which helped me in understanding whether a piece of text is an attribute or a user defined value.
###### `What Ubuntu commands are required to deploy and run your server?`
###### The following commands were used in order to deploy and run my project on the Server.
* ###### For adding the changes present on the local machine to the Heroku's git server:
* `git add .`
* ###### For committing changes to the Heroku's git server.
* `git commit -m "Comments"`

* ###### For deploying the commited changes to Heroku Server.
* `git push heroku master`
